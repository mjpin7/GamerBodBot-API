# GamerBodBot-API

This repo contains source code for my REST-API to be used by my bot [GamerBotBot](https://github.com/mjpin7/GamerBodBot). The API is deployed on Heroku and is currently being used. It uses a user system to authenticate users to access endpoints. Also connects to a PostgreSQL database for various storage.
